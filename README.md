#Introduction:

###Welcome to Lanny's birthday quiz. Here you can test your knowledge about Lanny, just in time for his birthday. <a href="https://dizarimia.github.io/lanny70/" target="_blank">Live Page</a>


##1 Features:

Navigation Bar: Complete with links to my pages, identical on each page for easy navigation. Who wants to have to press 'back' if you don't have to, just click where you want to go.

Landing page images, the background is from https://unsplash.com/@darsh83, I chose this one because I loved the colours. The picture with the quiz is an old picture of Lanny. 

Video: A very merry unbirthday from Alice in Wonderland, perfectly weird for my family.

The Attending form page includes an attending form with an allergy box. The Submit button clears the page. It is a mock-up page by choice, as everyone invited has already responded. But I wanted this page in case of future parties.
It also includes contact information.

Footer: I had no need for a footer for this specific website.

##2 Future ideas: If I use this as a base for a future invite, I will make it so that the submit button send the information to my mail. 

##3 Technologies used: I've used HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

##4 Testing: I have sent the webpage to several friends to test on different phones, tablets and browsers. It works well on everything I've tested, but looks best on bigger screens. I've also done the W3C validator and Jigsaw validator. I've also used a spellchecker since English isn't my first language. Specifically checked spelling in British because to me that's the real English. Lighthouse testing: ![Lighthouse test](https://github.com/Dizarimia/lanny70/blob/main/assets/images/lighthouse.png?) The large images is the main issue.

##5 Bugs: The imagefiles are a bit too big.

##6 Deployment: The site was deployed to GitHub pages. The steps to deploy are as follows: In the GitHub repository, navigate to the Settings tab From the source section drop-down menu, select the main Branch Once the main branch has been selected, the page will be automatically refreshed with a detailed ribbon display to indicate the successful deployment.

So easy, even I could do it.

##7 Credits: I have had a lot of help on this project from my mentor who is a very good teacher.

I used the template https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template because it makes life easier. Table of content order and help with information: https://github.com/dhakal79/readme-template.
I had help from my mentor with some of the code. 

##8 Media: The picture of my dad is taken by me. ![Homepage](https://github.com/Dizarimia/lanny70/blob/main/assets/images/home.png?) ![AttendForm](https://github.com/Dizarimia/lanny70/blob/main/assets/images/attend.png?)
